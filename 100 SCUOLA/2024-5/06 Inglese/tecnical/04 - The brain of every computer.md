## How a computer wakes up - {66}
When you press the start button of a pc, it goes throught several complex operations to ensure that every component is working properly.
### Boot
The term comes from the idea of lifting yourself up by your own boostraps.
In a PC this process is a must because it bring to life all the components to load the OS.
### OS
Once the OS is fully loaded, it takes more complicated tasks, like making the PC's hardware interact with software.
### POST
the power-on self-test is a sequenze of operations that checks if every hardware components are running and functioning properly.
### CPU
The central processing unit is the ultimate computer brain.
Other brains that are inside a pc such as RAM, disk drives, monitor exist only to help you interact with the CPU.
### Other microprocessors
In a PC there are other microporcessor like coprocessors on graphics, 3D accellerators and sound cards.
We got also special processors like the one inside keyboards that hadles signals and convert them in input.

## The central processing unit {67}
the *CPU* is the core of every computer.
### His work
His job is to process the raw data and elaborate them in information.
It runs computer programs, responding to the user input.
### General purpose
CPUs are designed to be general-purpose, this means that they are able to performe any sort of computer program that the user might want to use.
### Components of a CPU
#### CU (Control Unit)
Coordinates the input and output devices.
#### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
Where the calculation and logical decisions are made
#### IAS (Immediate Access Store)
It provides immediate memory for holding data and programs.
### How a CPU work
The CPU just follows instruction, so we can simpli say that a program is a list of instructions and the CPU performe each of them in sequence.
### Load/Store instrucions & aritgmetic instructions
These are the two most important type of operations.
Every single software needs to use these two type of operations.


## How to CPU executes program instrucions {68}
As we said earlier, the CPU simply executes instructions, but how this process happen?
### How fast
Nowadays every CPU can perform billions of operations each second.
### Before the CPU performe the instruction
Before an instrucion can be executed, program instrucions and data must be placed into memory from an input device or a secondary storage device.
### The CPU performe each instruction
The CPU performs the following four steps for each instrucion:
1. The CU takes the instruction from the memory
2. The CU decodes the instrucion in a language readeble by the ALU and move the necessary data to the ALU.

These two first steps are called the Instrucion time (I-Time)

3. The ALU executes the operation, and elaborate the data.
4. The ALU stores the result of the operation in the memory.

The last two steps are called the Execution time (E-Time)

### Combination of I & E time
The combination of these steps is called the machien cycle.

## The computer on a chip {69}
The road map of the chips.
The invection of the light bulb in late 1800 symbolized the beginning of the electronics. 
Then they started using vacuum tubes, then transistors and now integrated circuits.

### Current technology 
Current chip technology allow to place bilions of transistors and electronic switches on a single chip.

### Smaller is better
They goal is to pack as many circuit elements as possible into the structure of a chip, this is called *scalling*.
As transistors become smaller the chip become faster, conducts more electricityand uses less power.

## Memory {70}
Is it usefull to store data. The CPU
